In this data cleaning project, i examined Nahville's housing data using my SQL skills. One of the key step was ensuring data quality.
Using SQL queries I standardized date format, check for null values and fill out null values.
I splitted the address column seperating the address, city and state into three seperate column.
Replaced abbreviations with the correct words, removed duplicates, delete unused columns, updated each of these queries in the dataset. 
At the end of this data cleaning process, our data is ready to be analyzed for a data-driven insight.
